What happens if there are more guests trying to be checked in than there is free space in the room?

If you have one guest to be checked in:
  - Check if the current number of guests in room is below the room capacity to calculate the available spaces
  - If there is 1 or more available spaces
  - Add the guest to the room

If you have a guest group to be checked in:
  - Check if the group is bigger than the room capacity
  - Check if the current number of guests in the room is below the room capacity to calculate the available spaces
  - If the number of the guests in the guest group is equal to or less than the available spaces
  - Add the guest group to the room
